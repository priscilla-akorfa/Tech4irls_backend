Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the most effective approach to writing software. in Object-Oriented programming, you create or write classes that representsreal world things as well as situations and the create your objects that are based on these classes.

Four Main Principles:
Encapsulation: this involves grouping data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.

Abstraction: this hides the complex implementation details of an object and only exposes what is necessary for the user.

Inheritance: this allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviord from an existing class or parent, enabling code reuse.

Polymorphism: This allow objects from different classes to be treated as instances of a common parent class, with each object implementing methods in its own way.

Benefits of OOP:
1. OOP makes code more organized and easier to manage.
2. OOP helps reduce code duplication, making it more efficient.
3. OOP makes it easier to update and fix code without affecting other parts.
4. OOP makes it easier to add new features or objects without disrupting existing code.
