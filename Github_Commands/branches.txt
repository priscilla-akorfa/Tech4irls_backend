The difference between the home directory and the root directory is that the root directory is the starting point of all directory in the Linux hierarchy. It contains all other directories as well as files. The command is represented with cd / whilst the home directory stores directory for every user that is its a personnalised space allocated to each individual user stored within the root and its command is represented with cd home. The purpose of the git pull is to pull or fetch a file from a remote repository to the local machine. Additionally an individual uses git pull when he has made changes in his repository as well as to keep the local machine updated in order to keep both the remote and local machine in sync in order to avoid unecessary conflicts.
